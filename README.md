Overview
This project focuses on classifying different types of audio signals using a machine learning or deep learning model. The key steps include:

Loading and preprocessing the audio data.
Extracting features from the audio files, such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
Training a classification model to distinguish between different audio classes.
Evaluating the model performance.
Features
Audio Preprocessing: Converting raw audio files into features suitable for model input.
Feature Extraction: Extracting key audio features like MFCC, chroma, and spectral contrast.
Modeling: Building machine learning or neural network models for classification.
Evaluation: Performance metrics and model evaluation through accuracy and confusion matrix.

Usage
Preprocess the Audio Data: Start by loading your dataset and performing audio preprocessing.
Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the audio signals using LibROSA or similar libraries.
Model Training: Train a model using the extracted features. You can use traditional classifiers (SVM, Random Forest) or deep learning (Convolutional Neural Networks, RNNs).
Evaluate the Model: Test the trained model on the validation/test data and visualize the results.
Run the notebook to execute all the steps:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook AUDIO_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb
Model Architecture
The model used in this project can vary based on your implementation. Common architectures for audio classification include:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): For learning patterns in the spectrograms of audio signals.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN/LSTM): For capturing temporal dependencies in audio sequences.
Details of the model architecture are provided in the notebook.

Results
Include a brief summary of the model’s performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and any other relevant metrics. You can also provide examples of the confusion matrix and other visualizations.

Example:

Model Accuracy: 92%
Precision: 91%
Recall: 89%
